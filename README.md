[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/StefanKjartansson/stadfangaskra-rest.png)](http://travis-ci.org/StefanKjartansson/stadfangaskra-rest)

REST service for geocoding Icelandic addresses written in golang. Loads a `json` fixture file into memory containing the Icelandic placename information sourced from the csv file from [Opin GÃ¶gn](http://gogn.island.is/).

## Why?

Needed a very fast service to geocode addresses and wanted to try golang.

It's very fast, request time ranges from a puny 0.01 ms to 15.ms depending on volume of data returned.

### Benchmarks

All benchmark ran on a 2012 Macbook Pro, 20 concurrent connections, 4 threads and 30 seconds

#### Large set

All addresses in postcode 101.

```bash
wrk -c 20 -d 30 -t 4 "http://localhost:3999/locations/?postcode=101"
Running 30s test @ http://localhost:3999/locations/?postcode=101

#### Single address

```bash
